Note: I'll most likely abandon this. 

The idea behind this application was to help ease the pain and tension when rolling out a new version to production. It would assign people specific tasks and they would be able to mark them complete, pending, or escalation in a web interface rather than spamming people's email inboxes. And people would opt into following release (like twitter) rather than getting forced email updates they don't care about.
